                    Currently I work and live in Seattle, Washington. I am a bartender and manager at a large corporate restaurant. I am using the Treehouse Techdegree program to learn front end technologies and will complete their program to achieve a front end certification (for whatever that's worth). I am also active on Freecodecamp and Codecademy. I frequently find myself on W3Schools and Mozilla Developer Network for addition learning. StackOverflow has also become my close friend.

                <p>
                    I began learing HTML, CSS, and Javascript in January of 2016. I have no programming experience prior to this. It is my intention to have a comprehensive understanding of these languages before the year is over. I have also started teaching myself Ruby and have dabbled a bit with Java. Ultimately I would like to leave the restaurant industry. I don't know how possible this is without a degree of any kind, let alone a CS degree, but I plan on finding out. I spend 2-5 hours learning, 7 days a week, and have no plans of slowing down.
